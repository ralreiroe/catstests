/**
  * You often have several functions where in a sequence the next function needs the previous function's output as its input.
  * A => B, B => C
  * We can compose those easily.
  *
  * Also, more often than not these functions return a higher kinded type.
  * A => F[B], B => F[C]
  *
  * You want to compose these functions.
  *
  * To do this you need something that takes the inside of F[B] and passes it to the next function.
  *
  *
  * "Libraries that are fully non-blocking with asynchronous I/O operation usually encapsulated their return types in types like futures , one example of such libraries is reactivemongo. When using such libraries you will likely have to use thefuture â€˜s flatmap method in composing multiple operations together."
  *
  *
  * Looking carefully at the return types of the service methods(options), we can simply flatmap everything.
